# Dice Game ðŸŽ²
The dice game is a project that I learned from Dr. Angela Yu Udemy online course.
Through this course I learned to set multiple variables and set attributes to change different images when page is refreshed.
The project is based of finding a random number and finding the dice that equal the random number and distplaying that image.
The winner is chosen with a for loop to determine who won !

## How To Play
To play the game it's simple, simply refresh the page to once or multiple times to give a different winner or a draw.
